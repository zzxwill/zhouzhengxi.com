Darwin and iOS

Go 1.16 adds support of 64-bit ARM architecture on macOS (also known as Apple Silicon) with GOOS=darwin, GOARCH=arm64.
Like the darwin/amd64 port, the darwin/arm64 port supports cgo, internal and external linking, c-archive, c-shared, and
pie build modes, and the race detector.

The iOS port, which was previously darwin/arm64, has been renamed to ios/arm64. GOOS=ios implies the darwin build tag,
just as GOOS=android implies the linux build tag. This change should be transparent to anyone using gomobile to build
iOS apps.
