读 <<Oprah Winfrey>>

在8月20号回家的车上读完了《Oprah Winfrey》,她或她的父亲有一些很有道理的话。

1. For every one of us \[who\] succeeds, it’s because there was somebody out there to show you the way out. The light doesn’t necessarily to be your family, for me it was teachers and schools.
2. There are three different kinds of people in the world. There are those who make things happen. There are those who watch things happen. There are those who do not know what is happening.

在欧普拉.温弗瑞持续增肥，而总处于不断反复的过程中。

Some believed that the extra weight was like a shield, protecting Oprah from those who might hurt her.
