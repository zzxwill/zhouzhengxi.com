**Remarks of President Barack Obama** ****Weekly Address** **The White House** **January 1, 2011****

Hello, everybody.  As we close the books on one year and begin another, I wanted to take a moment today to wish you a very Happy New Year and talk a little bit about the year that lies ahead.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

大家好，当我们为这一年合上书本上，我们开始翻开另一年，今天我想花点时间祝大家新年快乐，同时，谈论一点即将到来的一年。

At the start of 2011, we’re still just emerging from a once-in-a-lifetime recession that’s taken a terrible toll on millions of families.  We all have friends and neighbors trying to get their lives back on track.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

2011年初，我们刚刚从更古未有，使数以百万的家庭遭受损失的衰退中走出来了。我们的朋友和邻居都在尽力使他们的生活步入正轨。

1. emerging from: to come to the end of a difficult period or experience
2. once-in-a-lifetime
3. toll: suffering, deaths or damage

We are, however, riding a few months of economic news that suggests our recovery is gaining traction.  And our most important task now is to keep that recovery going.  As President, that’s my commitment to you: to do everything I can to make sure our economy is growing, creating jobs, and strengthening our middle class.  That’s my resolution for the coming year.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

然而，【空白，待翻译】。我们现在最重要的任务是继续保持这种复苏。作为总统，这是我对你们的承诺：做任何我能做的是经济增长，创造工作，加强中层阶级的事。对是我的新年决心。

1. ride:     To seem to float
2. traction: the pulling of a heavy load over a surface, or the power used in this

Still, even as we work to boost our economy in the short-term, it’s time to make some serious decisions about how to keep our economy strong, growing, and competitive in the long run.  We have to look ahead – not just to this year, but to the next 10 years, and the next 20 years.  Where will new innovations come from?  How will we attract the companies of tomorrow to set up shop and create jobs in our communities?  What will it take to get those jobs?  What will it take to out-compete other countries around the world?  What will it take to see the American Dream come true for our children and grandchildren?

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

尽管我们依然在为近期的经济复苏而努力，但是，从长远的角度来看，是时候为如何保持经济强壮，增长和有竞争力而做出严肃的决定。我们必须向前看，不仅仅是这一年，也是后面十年，后面二十年。新的创新会在哪里产生？我们将怎样吸引未来的公司在社区里开商店并创造工作？获得这些工作意味着什么？怎样在竞争中比其他国家做得更好？怎么是我们孩子和孙子的美国梦变成现实？

1. out-compete: To be more successful than a competitor; especially to thrive in the presence of an organism that is competing for resources

Our parents and grandparents asked themselves those questions.  And because they had the courage to answer them, we’ve had the good fortune to grow up in the greatest nation on Earth.

Now it’s our turn to think about the future.  In a few days, a new Congress will form, with one house controlled by Democrats, and one house controlled by Republicans – who now have a shared responsibility to move this country forward.  And here’s what I want you to know: I’m willing to work with anyone of either party who’s got a good idea and the commitment to see it through.  And we should all expect you to hold us accountable for our progress or our failure to deliver.

As I’ve said since I first ran for this office, solving our challenges won’t be quick or easy.  We have come through a difficult decade; one of new threats and new trials we didn’t expect when it began.  But a new year and a new decade stretch out before us.  And if we just remember what America is capable of, and live up to that legacy, then I’m confident that we are poised for a period of progress – one in which our economy is growing, our standing in the world is rising, and we do what it takes to make sure America remains in the 21st century what it was in the 20th: the greatest country in the world.

Thanks for listening.  And Happy New Year.
