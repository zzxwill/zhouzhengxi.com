研究CXF，在CXF User's Guide上看到：

 

> With that said, there are bound to be gaps in our documentation and software. We would love to hear your feedback about what needs more work. The easiest way to send feedback is to signup for the [mailing list](http://cxf.apache.org/mailing-lists.html). If you've found a bug, you can file an issue report via [JIRA](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF). If you would like to get involved in the community yourself, we would[welcome your contributions and involvement](http://cxf.apache.org/getting-involved.html).

 

牛哄哄的Apache居然在用JIRA, 这让我为小组找的Bug管理工具的决策放心了, WOW!
